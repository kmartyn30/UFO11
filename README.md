  This became a commmunity of UFO site seekers. 

Summary: 
One drawback of this webpage was the arranging of the html page listing the city, state, country, and shape. then completed the app.js in javascript. The data was originally not loading into the webpage consistly.

 Two additional recommendations I would suggest would be additional tables based on the location of that UFO sites that were seen in the same area. Secondly, it would be suggested to gather colloaborative information on the shape and durantion in which was seen the same location. This would require two additional tables seperating the other data. As well if the data and comments hasd pictures taken to be upload for viewing.
