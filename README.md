 Dana was to sign a webpage and dynamic talbe to provide an insigh on traveling UFO sights. In doing so a table was to be created to filter the data into the table on the city, state, country, shape of the UFO and comments. 
 In the Challege Dana created the fliter table to break down all of the cities, states and countries that viewed UFO at a particular date time and the shape of the UFO that the person viewed and how long did they view the UFO for at that sight. 

PURPOSE of WEBPAGE:

* Create, update, and iterate JavaScript objects.



 The change in the challege that Dana added were to the html were to add four elements "City, State, Country and shape of the UFO". This was to read the data into the web to create an opportunity to input in the buttons the date to obtain the data. This was to determine the area that the UFO was seen, the shape and duration the UFO was viewed in that particular cite. The cite gathered data along with provided a section for details.  

The filter search gathered data in UFO findings by date, city, state, country, and the shape of the UFO.  As you can see the data that was entered into the webpage to compare various UFO findings.
