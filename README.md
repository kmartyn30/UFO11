 UFO Anaylsis
 Dana was to sign a webpage and dynamic talbe to provide an insigh on traveling UFO sights. In doing so a table was to be created to filter the data into the table on the city, state, country, shape of the UFO and comments. 
 In the Challege Dana created the fliter table to break down all of the cities, states and countries that viewed UFO at a particular date time and the shape of the UFO that the person viewed and how long did they view the UFO for at that sight. 

##PURPOSE of WEBPAGE:

  The purpose Dana created a webpage to see how someone might use the webpage to filter information on UFOs.  
Dana goal was to designs an inteactive webpage that allowed readers to parse data around sights that viewed UFOs.  She was going to design the webpage with an HTML data and link with a presentation in Javascript. She wanted to create a storyboards for her readersinto a webpage by first outlining the elements of the webpage such as title, summary, article title and a table. She created the table with the page header, navagation bar, table, article and article paragraph. She wanted to investigate UFO sightings was it fact or fancy?  She choose the title "The Truth is Out There" The top section of the webpage was devoted to UFO sighting articles to draw in her readers and to ask for people to provided information.

##TOOlS used for webpage and data:

The website entailed using HTML and Javascript in vscode. 
* Javascript, HTMLmand CSS
* Create, update, and iterate JavaScript objects.

#Analysis Results:
 The change in the challege that Dana added were to the html were to add four elements "City, State, Country and shape of the UFO". This was to read the data into the web to create an opportunity to input in the buttons the date to obtain the data. This was to determine the area that the UFO was seen, the shape and duration the UFO was viewed in that particular cite. The cite gathered data along with provided a section for details.  

The filter search gathered data in UFO findings by date, city, state, country, and the shape of the UFO.  As you can see the data that was entered into the webpage to compare various UFO findings. To search with images you will input informaion into the search.

  This became a commmunity of UFO site seekers. 

Summary: 
One drawback of this webpage was the arranging of the html page listing the city, state, country, and shape. then completed the app.js in javascript. The data was originally not loading into the webpage consistly.

 Two additional recommendations I would suggest would be additional tables based on the location of that UFO sites that were seen in the same area. Secondly, it would be suggested to gather colloaborative information on the shape and durantion in which was seen the same location. This would require two additional tables seperating the other data. As well if the data and comments hasd pictures taken to be upload for viewing.
